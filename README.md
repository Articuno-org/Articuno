Instruction:
- Install requirements library: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
- Put your bot's token in ``.env`` file after ``TOKEN=``.
- Run ``python main.py``

- Must work with Python ``3.8.6`` and higher.
- Breaking change/new feature implementation must be documented precisely.
- We do not accept abstraction-based requests. (e.g. ``colour`` for ``color``)
