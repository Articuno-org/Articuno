# Running the bot
Go figure it by yourself. This repository is for educational purposes and copying code will not make you a good developer.

# Contributing
Contribution is welcomed. However, we require you to follow our set of rules:
- Follow the repository schema. (Breaking it will result in your Pull Request get closed)
- Must work with Python ``3.8.6`` and higher.
- Breaking change/new feature implementation must be documented precisely.
- We do not accept abstraction-based requests. (e.g. ``colour`` for ``color``)
- You must be willing to change/adhere to reviews from participants where necessary. (Pull Request/Issues may be closed if we do not feel it is necessary to be added)

# What makes us different?
First and always, API wrapper library. Being developed using Python, many developers will go with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). We think discord.py is a good library, however, it violates the API and does not follow the API guild schema. With all of those reasons, we decided to follow [interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/library), a Python Discord API Wrapper, focusing on interaction based. A wrapper with proper Objects, Classes, and most importantly, interactions.py follows the API guide from Discord, which is a huge pro for the library itself.
