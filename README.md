# Articuno (discord-interactions)
A small and fun Discord Bot that is written in Python and discord-interactions (with discord.py)

# Get started
If you want to host the bot by yoursel, you must do these steps:
- Put your bot's token in ./data/config.json. You can get your bot's token at [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Install required libraries in ``requirements.txt`` by using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``


# For legacy code
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) is discontinued. However, a new fork called [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) was created and has been developed based on the beta version(2.0) of discord.py

[Main branch](https://github.com/Jimmy-Blue/Articuno/tree/discord-interactions) will be for discord-interactions and [legacy branch](https://github.com/Jimmy-Blue/Articuno/tree/pycord) will be for pycord

I suggest using the discord-interactions as Discord is slowly revoking the ability to use bots with ``$``, ``!``, ``?``, etc and they are working on forcing people to use the new slash command system ``/``.
